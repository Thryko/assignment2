<b>Operation Paperclip</b>Â was a secret program of theÂ Joint Intelligence Objectives AgencyÂ (JIOA) in which more than 1,600 German scientists, engineers, and technicians, such asÂ Wernher von BraunÂ and hisÂ V-2 rocketÂ team, were recruited in post-Nazi Germany and taken to the U.S. for government employment, at the end ofÂ World War II; many were members and some were leaders of theÂ Nazi Party.

The primary purpose for Operation Paperclip was U.S. military advantage in the Russoâ€“AmericanÂ Cold War, and theÂ Space Race. The Soviet Union were more aggressive in recruiting some 2,000 German scientists withÂ Operation OsoaviakhimÂ during one night.

TheÂ Joint Chiefs of StaffÂ (JCS) established the first secret recruitment program, called Operation Overcast, on July 20, 1945, initially "to assist in shortening the Japanese war and to aid our postwar military research".Â The term "Overcast" was the name first given by the German scientists' family members for the housing camp where they were held in Bavaria.Â In late summer 1945, the JCS established theÂ Joint Intelligence Objectives AgencyÂ (JIOA), a subcommmittee of the Joint Intelligence Community, to directly oversee Operation Overcast and later Operation Paperclip.

The JIOA had one representative of each member agency of the Joint Intelligence Committee: the army's director of intelligence, the chief of naval intelligence, the assistant chief of Air Staff-2 (air force intelligence), and a representative from the State Department.Â In November 1945, Operation Overcast was renamed Operation Paperclip byÂ Ordnance Corps (United States Army)Â officers, who would attach a paperclip to the folders of those rocket experts whom they wished to employ in America.Â In a secret directive circulated on September 3, 1946,Â President TrumanÂ officially approved Operation Paperclip and expanded it to include one thousand German scientists under "temporary, limited military custody".

<b>Operation Osoaviakhim</b>Â was aÂ SovietÂ operation analogous to Operation Paperclip which took place on 22 October 1946, withÂ NKVDÂ and Soviet army units forcibly (at gunpoint) recruiting more than 2,000 German technical specialists and scientists from theÂ Soviet occupation zoneÂ of post-World War IIÂ Germany for employment in the Soviet Union.Â Much related equipment was moved too, the aim being to literally transplant research and production centres, such as the relocatedÂ V-2 rocketÂ centre atÂ MittelwerkÂ Nordhausen, from Germany to the Soviet Union, and collect as much material as possible from test centres such as the Luftwaffe's central military aviation test centre atÂ Erprobungstelle Rechlin, taken by the Red Army on 2 May 1945. The codename "Osoaviakhim" was the acronym of a Soviet paramilitary organisation, later renamedÂ DOSAAF.

The operation was commanded byÂ NKVDÂ deputyÂ Colonel General Serov, outside the control of the localÂ Soviet Military AdministrationÂ (which in a few cases, such asÂ Carl Zeiss AG, tried to prevent the removal of specialists and equipment of vital economic significance for the occupation zone,Â unsuccessfully, as it turned out, with reportedly only 582 of 10,000 machines left in place at Zeiss). Planned some time in advance to take place after theÂ zone's elections on 20 October, to avoid damaging theÂ Bloc of the Anti-Fascist Democratic PartiesÂ Unity List's result, the operation took 92 trains to transport the specialists and their families (perhaps 10,000-15,000 people in all) along with their furniture and belongings.Â Whilst those removed were offered contracts (the specialists were told that they would be paid on the same terms as equivalent Soviet workers), there was little doubt that failing to sign them was not a realistic option.

A major consideration of the Soviet decision to undertake the operation was fear of the German economy and technological potential re-acclimatizing amidst the cooperation of Soviet and German technical experts after the war, and the simultaneous desire to cultivate this technological potential for the Soviet Union's benefit (especially as it concerned the nascent rocket program thereof).Â In particular, A. G. Myrkin of the Soviet artillery directorate wrote a letter to the head of NKVD operations in Germany complaining about the prominence of German scientists in important state-secure work.Â Another possible reason for the operation was the Soviet fear of being condemned for noncompliance withÂ Allied Control CouncilÂ agreements on the liquidation of German military installations.[citation needed]Â New agreements were expected on four-power inspections of remaining German war potential, which the Soviets supported, being concerned about developments in the western zones.Â The operation has parallels with Allied operations such as Operation Overcast,Â Operation Paperclip, andÂ Operation Alsos, in which the Allies brought military specialists, notablyÂ Wernher von Braun, from Germany (primarily to the United States).";s:10:"post_title";s:44:"Operation Paperclip and Operation Osoavakhim";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:19:"operation-paperclip";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2017-10-02 01:59:11";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2017-10-02 08:59:11";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:23:"http://localhost/?p=171";s:10:"menu_order";s:2:"10";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
